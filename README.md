# 68060 in Macintosh Quadra650
Some ugly ROM hacking to get a minimum level of functionality out of a Macintosh Quadra 650/800 or Centris 650 with a 68060 installed on an appropriate adapter.

Thanks to Jockelill for a pointer on the MMU ROM Mapping and Aprezbios for supplying a scrap 060 to play with.
