TODO / Known bugs

    System 7.5 hangs in boot at welcome to macintosh, probably FPU-related.

    branch cache probably not working
        no change in performance noted if changed at installfpsp time. might be cleared somewhere
        may need to begin clearing at similar times to ATC?

    FPU   
        no FPU detected in tattletech or speedometer
            might happen at early boot while we have the FPU disabled
        sane trap behavior wrt 040 probably needs expansion
            hands over to system handlers for some of the traps not used for 040 but 060 fpsp would use those
        seems to cause crashes if FPU code is called.
        TESTFORFPU happens very early in boot

    bus error handling (in general)
        Need to correctly handled the new exception stack frame in slot manager  PATCH_SLOTMGR_BERR_HACK

    SPs
        need to hand off to appropriate vectors off VBR for stuff like /v, chk, etc


### DONE??

    almost certainly won't work in 24 bit mode as fpsp/isp are after the 1MB ROM mapping boundary (80000 - 8FFFFF) 
        probably just have to accept that
        patch to force 32 bit added
