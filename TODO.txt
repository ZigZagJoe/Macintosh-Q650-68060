TODO / Known bugs

    System 7.5 hangs in boot at welcome to macintosh, probably FPU-related.

    FPU   
        no FPU detected in tattletech or speedometer
            might happen at early boot while we have the FPU disabled. 
            yes, it does. TESTFORFPU happens very early in boot
        sane trap behavior wrt 040 probably needs expansion
            hands over to system handlers for some of the traps not used for 040 but 060 fpsp would use those
        seems to cause hangs if FPU code is called with no fpsp
            this is the same issue 040 rom has; fixed via a resource tweak
        
        fsave/frestore
            anything that looks at the content of the frame or makes an assumption about the frame is gonna have a problem

    bus error handling (in general)
        Need to correctly handle the new exception stack frame in slot manager  PATCH_SLOTMGR_BERR_HACK
        as well as anything else that actually uses the fields from the handler...
        need to handle branch cache also (this seems to happen rarely, at least, but still must check)
        seems like this can probably just be a hop to genexcps always and hope nobody touches the handler
        ** probably branch cache should be turned on after slot manager completes - DONE **

    SPs need to hand off to appropriate vectors off VBR for excepetions like /v, chk, etc

    PRAM clear hangs on first go on finder but works after... why?

    memory/vram throughput is reduced vs 040
        25, 33mhz bus clocks
        but inexplicably fine at 32mhz
        does NOT show in L2 cache comparison without BC at 64 and 66 ???

### DONE??

    almost certainly won't work in 24 bit mode as fpsp/isp are after the 1MB ROM mapping boundary (80000 - 8FFFFF) 
        probably just have to accept that
        patch to force 32 bit added

    branch cache not working
        no change in performance noted if changed at installfpsp time. might be cleared somewhere
            it's cleared immediately afterwards, added a patch for 060 cache initialization
        may need to begin clearing at similar times to ATC
        critical problem: bus error (access error) handlers must check for branch predict error bit
            if set, clear branch cache and resume...
            bus error handler is monkeyed with very often....
        no the CPU just didn't like 66mhz

    On the other board the forced 32 bit hangs in early boot...?
        PRAM forcing issue
