TODO / Known bugs

    System 7.5 hangs in boot at welcome to macintosh, probably FPU-related.

    branch cache not working
        no change in performance noted if changed at installfpsp time. might be cleared somewhere
            it's cleared immediately afterwards, added a patch for 060 cache initialization
        may need to begin clearing at similar times to ATC
        critical problem: bus error (access error) handlers must check for branch predict error bit
            if set, clear branch cache and resume...
            bus error handler is monkeyed with very often....

    FPU   
        no FPU detected in tattletech or speedometer
            might happen at early boot while we have the FPU disabled
        sane trap behavior wrt 040 probably needs expansion
            hands over to system handlers for some of the traps not used for 040 but 060 fpsp would use those
        seems to cause crashes if FPU code is called.
        TESTFORFPU happens very early in boot

    bus error handling (in general)
        Need to correctly handle the new exception stack frame in slot manager  PATCH_SLOTMGR_BERR_HACK
        as well as anything else that actually uses the fields from the handler...
        need to handle branch cache also (this seems to happen rarely, at least, but still must check)

    SPs
        need to hand off to appropriate vectors off VBR for stuff like /v, chk, etc

    PRAM clear
        hangs on first go on finder but works after... why?

    On the other board the forced 32 bit hangs in early boot...?

### DONE??

    almost certainly won't work in 24 bit mode as fpsp/isp are after the 1MB ROM mapping boundary (80000 - 8FFFFF) 
        probably just have to accept that
        patch to force 32 bit added
