TODO / Known bugs  
    memory/vram throughput is reduced vs 040
        25, 33mhz bus clocks
        does NOT show in L2 cache comparison without BC at 64 and 66 ???
        let's try enabling superscalar late in boot. 
            Seems to fix timedbra calculation, though what does that affect?
        oddly, cbits l/a is consistent on 25mhz bclk

    bus error handler for slot manager  PATCH_SLOTMGR_BERR_HACK
        needs to be updated to actually check the fields correctly on the new one

    System 7.5 hangs in boot at welcome to macintosh
        code 10? fline?
        a vector might have been clobbered? 
        or a ptest? this would result in an illegal

    FPU & FPSP   
        sane trap behavior wrt 040 probably needs expansion / hand off from FPSP calls
            hands over to system handlers for some of the traps not used for 040 but 060 fpsp would use those
        seems to cause hangs if FPU code is called with no fpsp
            this is the same issue 040 rom has; fixed via a resource tweak
        fsave/frestore
            anything that looks at the content of the frame or makes an assumption about the frame is gonna have a problem

### NEEDS TESTING
    branch cache
        ** probably branch cache should be turned on after slot manager completes - DONE **
        need to verify bus except handler actually works correctly...
        supposedly some apps hate this, like Microsoft Word. If i were doing this for real a blacklist to disable BC while these apps are running would be indicated

    ISP need to hand off to appropriate vectors off VBR for exceptions like /v, chk, etc
        RTS_TO_VECTOR: DONE, UNTESTED

### DONE??
    FPU disable/LC CPUs
        have to change resource layout in universaltables. only done for q650 almost
        not sure what this affects?? maybe FPU-optional machines always use FPU-less SANE??

    PRAM clear hangs on first go on finder but works after... why?
        fixed, something to do with FPU i guess
        
    almost certainly won't work in 24 bit mode as fpsp/isp are after the 1MB ROM mapping boundary (80000 - 8FFFFF) 
        probably just have to accept that
        patch to force 32 bit added

    branch cache not working
        no change in performance noted if changed at installfpsp time. might be cleared somewhere
            it's cleared immediately afterwards, added a patch for 060 cache initialization
        may need to begin clearing at similar times to ATC
        critical problem: bus error (access error) handlers must check for branch predict error bit
            if set, clear branch cache and resume...
            bus error handler is monkeyed with very often....
        no the CPU just didn't like 66mhz

    On the other board the forced 32 bit hangs in early boot...?
        PRAM forcing issue

NOTES

no FPU detected in tattletech or speedometer
    fpu detect happen at early boot while we have the FPU disabled.
