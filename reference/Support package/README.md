# Support Package

The 68060 does not implement the complete instruction set of the 68040 or earlier CPUs. 
The support packages (integer and floating point) were distributed by motorola as a way to emulate the missing instructions in software transparently to user code.

This contains implementations of the 060 and 040 support packages, for reference. 
I assert no ownership of this code, it belongs to other projects and licenses may vary.
